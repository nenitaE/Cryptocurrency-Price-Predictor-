## Description

This was submitted as project one in our UNC Charlotte Fintech Bootcamp.  We developed an index entitled the "SNJ index" that attempts to use past cryptocurrency prices to predict future prices using Monte carlo simulation.  Based on the index we then created an AWS Lex Chatbot for users to interact with in order to get their cryptocurrency price prediction
